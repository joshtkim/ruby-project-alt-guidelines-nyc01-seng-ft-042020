Module One Final Project

Welcome to the World of Webtoons!

Our goal for this program was to connect our Readers, Writers, and Webtoons!
You can enter this program as a Reader or as a Writer to delve into the world of Webtoons.

As a Writer you will be able to:
  - create a new profile
  - list all your webtoons
  - delete a webtoon you no longer want to continue
  - update the weekly release day of a specific webtoon

As a Reader you will be able to:
  - list all current webtoons you are reading
  - find who the writer of your favorite webtoons are


This app will only continue to grow so please continue to be patient and provide feedback. Thank you for your loyalty to Webtoons and our program!!

Please continue to spread the word about our program!
